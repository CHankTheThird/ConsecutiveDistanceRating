Problem Description as taken from: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/759fha/20171009_challenge_335_easy_consecutive_distance/

Description

We'll call the consecutive distance rating of an integer sequence the sum of the distances between consecutive integers. 
Consider the sequence 1 7 2 11 8 34 3. 1 and 2 are consecutive integers, but their distance apart in the sequence is 2. 
2 and 3 are consecutive integers, and their distance is 4. The distance between 7 and 8 is 3. The sum of these distances is 9.
Your task is to find and display the consecutive distance rating of a number of integer sequences.

Input description

You'll be given two integers a and b on the first line denoting the number of sequences that follow and the length of those sequences, 
respectively. You'll then be given a integer sequences of length b, one per line. The integers will always be unique and range from 
1 to 100 inclusive.

Output description

Output each consecutive distance rating, one per line.
